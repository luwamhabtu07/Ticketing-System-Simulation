## ðŸ§ª Test Cases

We use `unittest` to validate:
- âœ… Normal case: 3-5 ticket flow
- âœ… Edge case: 0 tickets
- âœ… Edge case: very large number of tickets
- âœ… Edge case: negative input handled
- âœ… Edge case: string input handled

Run tests:
```bash
python -m unittest tests/test_ticket_system.py
